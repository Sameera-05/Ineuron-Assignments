    "When we want to access a certain part of code many times if we write it as a function then we can reuse the code by just calling the function which is easy and time saving.\n",
    "Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update. The main advantage of functions is code Reusability.\n"
